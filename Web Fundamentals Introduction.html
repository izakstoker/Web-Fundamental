<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>Hello everybody! My name is Izak Stoker.</p>
<p>I am looking to become a CIT (Computer Information Technology) major.</p>
<p>I've been a member my whole life. I am from Boise, ID. I Love the outdoors and Idaho is filled with secret locations that are so beautiful.</p>
<p>Hopefully when I am done earning my BS degree, I can go on to get my ethical hacker certificate.</p>
<p>I'm glad to be in this class as it will help me in my long term career needing to be knowledgable computer languages including html.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of myself:</p>
